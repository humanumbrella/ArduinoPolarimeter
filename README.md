# ArduinoPolarimeter
This project includes the firmware files to run on an Arduino Uno with an  Adafruit Motor Shield, pictured below. I was using both stepper motor ports and a Pololu motor driver to move a linear actuator. The firmware provides access to the motors and limit switches.

## Getting Started
To install the Arduino code, you'll need the Arduino IDE. This will allow you to push this code to your Arduino. However, you'll also need to have the motor shield attached.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
