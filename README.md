# ArduinoPolarimeter
This project includes the firmware files to run on an Arduino Uno with an  Adafruit Motor Shield, pictured below. I was using both stepper motor ports and a Pololu motor driver to move a linear actuator. The firmware provides access to the motors and limit switches with a protocol directly on the board. This protocol provides a serial interface to connect to the board via USB either directly or via another program.

## Getting Started
To install the Arduino code, you'll need the Arduino IDE. This will allow you to push this code to your Arduino. However, you'll also need to have the motor shield attached for this code to function properly.

### Prerequisites

Adafruit Motor Shield V2 [link](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield-v2-for-arduino/overview)

```
Put some examples here
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
going to do this
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

how to know it's set up properly?
